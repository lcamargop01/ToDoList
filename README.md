# ToDoList
# PacMen
## Project Description
A browser-based game where users can create Pac-men and bounce them around the screen. The user has the ability to create, pause, and stop animation.

## How To Run
(1) Download all files from the master branch of this repository into a directory on your local machine

index.html
pacmen.js
(2) Open index.html in browser (Google Chrome provides best results)

## Roadmap
The next improvement I plan to be working on is for the Pac-men to open and close their mouths as they move. Additionally, I would like the ability to move the pac-men based on where the cursor is.

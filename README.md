# ToDo List
## Project Description
A to-do list that can be altered in multiple ways - add new items and delete old. 

## How To Run
(1) Download all files from the master branch of this repository into a directory on your local machine 
<ul>
  <li> form.js </li>
  <li> index.js </li>
  <li> styles.css </li>
  <li> todo.js </li>
  <li> index.html </li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in browser (Google Chrome provides best results)

## Roadmap
The next improvement I plan to be working on is for the the lists to have check marks on the side to easily keep track of completed items. Additionally, I would like the ability to edit the items if something new needs to be added.
